# Contributing

Any change to behavior (including bugfixes) must come with a test.

These tests must fail without the patch, and pass with the patch.

Patches that fail tests or reduce test coverage will be rejected.

In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style.

```
# to run tests
npm test

# to run coverage
npm run cover

# to test coding style
npm run lint
```
